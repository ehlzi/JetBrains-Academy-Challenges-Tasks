# JetBrains-Academy-Project-ChattyBot

Learning outcomes
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.

"Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. 
During this journey, you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!"

What you'll learn:

### Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

- Computer programming

- Paradigms

- Introduction to Java

- Basic literals

- Overview of the basic program

- Printing data

### Introduce yourself to the bot.
- Types and variables

- Comments

- Scanning the input

- Coding style conventions

- Naming variables

### Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

- Arithmetic operations

- Integer types and operations

- Increment and decrement

- Characters

- String

### Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

- Boolean and logical operations

- Relational operators

- Conditional statement

- Ternary operator

- The for-loop

### At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions.
- Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
